# Personal Finance App - Frontend Mentor Challenge

### Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the Personal Finance App challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). The challenge provides a comprehensive Figma design, and my goal is to recreate it with pixel-perfect accuracy while adding interactive functionality. As a Guru-level challenge, it tests my ability to transform a complex design into a fully functional web application.

Working from the provided Figma design, I'm focusing on:

- Precise implementation of the design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Building a responsive layout that works across all devices
- Creating smooth interactions and transitions
- Implementing complex UI components like charts and data grids
- Ensuring accessibility standards are met

This project is part of my 2025 goal to maintain and enhance my frontend development skills, pushing my boundaries in modern web development practices.

This challenge showcases my frontend expertise through pixel-perfect design implementation, responsive layouts, modern CSS techniques, and state-of-the-art component architecture. By leveraging my choice of frontend frameworks and tools, I aim to demonstrate clean code practices, accessibility standards, and optimal performance optimization techniques that are essential in today's web development landscape.
