# Personal Finance App - Frontend Mentor Challenge

### Overview

This is a frontend implementation of the Personal Finance App challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). The project focuses on transforming a provided Figma design into a pixel-perfect, interactive web application.

Key aspects:

- Implementing the design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Responsive layout across all devices
- Interactive UI components including charts and data grids
- Modern frontend development practices

This project is part of my 2025 goal to maintain and enhance my frontend development skills, pushing my boundaries in modern web development practices.

This challenge showcases my frontend expertise through pixel-perfect design implementation, responsive layouts, modern CSS techniques, and state-of-the-art component architecture. By leveraging my choice of frontend frameworks and tools, I aim to demonstrate clean code practices, accessibility standards, and optimal performance optimization techniques that are essential in today's web development landscape.
